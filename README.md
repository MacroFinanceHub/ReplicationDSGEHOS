# Replication files for Mutschler (2018) - Higher-order statistics for DSGE models, Econometrics and Statistics, Volume 6, Pages 44-56, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosta.2016.10.005)

This code illustrates how to use **DYNARE** to 
- compute higher-order statistics (cumulants, moments, polyspectra up to fourth-order) 
- estimate with GMM using higher-order statistics (cumulants, moments, polyspectra up to fourth-order)
- include Student's t distributed errors

for DSGE models solved by a perturbation approximation approach up to third-order. The HOS and GMM toolbox are both model-independent.

The main file is `XRunForReplication.m`
